# Scoped `.issp` Distribution — for the secretariat

The ISSP Builder is local-first: there is no server or login. **Scoped distribution**
lets the secretariat (the CIO office) split the agency ISSP across contributing
offices using `.issp` files alone — each office sees and fills only the fields
assigned to them, and the secretariat merges everything back into one master.

## The workflow at a glance

```
 Secretariat (master)            Office (scoped file)           Secretariat (master)
 ─────────────────────           ────────────────────           ─────────────────────
 1. Distribute          ──┐    3. Open their .issp
    pick fields per        ├──> sees ONLY their fields
    office → generate      │    fills them in, saves
    one .issp each         │    returns the file
                          ┌┘                                ┌──> 4. Consolidate
                          └─────────────────────────────────┤       review + apply
                                                              └──> 5. Export PDF
```

Only the consolidated master produces the official PDF.

## 1. Distribute (secretariat)

1. Open the **master** ISSP in the editor.
2. Click **Distribute to offices…** (in the sidebar's file-actions ⋯ menu — only visible on a master).
3. For each contributing office: type a name, then tick the areas / sections /
   fields that office owns in the tree. You can be as coarse as a whole Part or as
   fine as a single field (e.g. only *Part I-B → CIO Name*).
4. **Generate files** → one scoped `.issp` per office downloads. Send each office
   their file (email, shared drive — whatever you use).

The generated file carries only that office's owned fields plus the agency header
(name, years, etc.) so it's self-identifying. Everything else is stripped — Office
B cannot see Office A's data.

## 2. Edit (each office)

1. The office opens their `.issp` in the ISSP Builder (same app — Home → Load).
2. They land in **scoped mode**: only their assigned sections/fields show, a banner
   reads *"Scoped file — \<office\>"*, and **PDF export is hidden**.
3. They fill in their fields and add any rows they own (stakeholders, Annex 1
   inventory). Every row they add is silently stamped with their office id.
4. They **save** the `.issp` (it stays scoped) and return it to the secretariat.

Office identity (name + the hidden stable id) is fixed when the file is generated.
If you need to change which office owns what, generate a new file rather than
editing the scope by hand.

## 3. Consolidate (secretariat)

1. Open the **master** → **Consolidate returned files…** (sidebar file-actions ⋯ menu).
2. Select one or more returned `.issp` files. Files made with an older version of
   the tool are **upgraded** first (the office chip says "upgraded from vN"); data
   the older version could not hold keeps the master's value.
3. The **merge review** opens full-screen. Nothing changes until you click
   **Apply merge**. It compares the master with what the files would make it:
   - The **summary bar** leads with what needs attention — unresolved conflicts,
     overwrites, clears, removals, broken links, file warnings — each a jump link.
     Filter by office; tick **Show unchanged** to see untouched fields too.
   - Sections run in document order. Each change is tagged **New**,
     **Overwritten**, **Cleared**, **Added row**, **Replaced row** (expand to see
     the changed fields), **Removed row**, **Appended** (two offices added rows),
     **Kept (office deleted)**, or **Office rows replaced** (stakeholders,
     Annex 1), with the office that made it and **Master | Incoming** side by side.
     Text shows word-level highlights; diagrams show both images; Part IV shows
     each line item's cost change and the budget totals per bucket.
   - **Keep the master's value** on any Overwritten, Cleared, Replaced-row or
     Removed-row change discards that office's change. In a flagged section,
     **Don't add this row** skips a likely duplicate.
   - A **conflict** (two offices changed the same field or row differently, or one
     edited a row another deleted) has no default: pick an office's version or
     **Keep master value**. Apply stays off until every conflict is answered.
   - **A file may belong to another ISSP** warns when a file's agency, title or
     years differ from the master's. **Links would break** names any reference
     (concern → program, project → proposed system, KPIs/budget → project) the
     merge would leave pointing at nothing.
4. **Apply merge**. The master is updated; sections that still need a look keep a
   **review flag** (a banner on the section + a badge in the sidebar).

Offices' files are judged against the master: a field or row an office returned
unchanged is not a change, so only real edits count, and file order never
decides a winner. Re-importing an office's file is idempotent — it replaces
*their* rows/fields and leaves everyone else's untouched, so you can
re-consolidate corrected files freely.

## 4. Review flags

After consolidating, flagged sections show a **"Flagged during consolidation"**
banner ("Multiple scoped files contributed to this section — review for duplicates
or conflicting entries, then clear the flag."). Check the section, remove
duplicates, then click **Mark reviewed** to clear the flag.

## 5. Export the official PDF

Once the master is consolidated, **Export PDF** produces the official agency ISSP.
Scoped files cannot export PDF — only the master can.

## Distribute a single project (per-project files)

When an office's scope includes any project-bearing field (Part III-E1/E2,
III-F, or a Part IV year), the Distribute dialog shows a **Projects** panel:

- **All projects** — the office receives every project row (previous behavior).
- **Selected projects only** — pick exact projects; the file carries only
  those rows in III-E/F and the Part IV budgets, pre-populated from the
  master. Single-project files are named after the project
  (`SMK-ISSP-2028-2030-sikap.issp`).
- **Start empty** — no project rows travel; the office adds its own.

Recipients edit their project's details, KPIs, and budget lines, and may add
new projects. On **Consolidate**, project data merges **by project id**:
edits replace the master's rows, new projects union in with a review flag,
and a project the recipient deleted is kept on the master and flagged —
deletion never propagates silently.

A project-filtered file stays out of everything agency-wide, except where
its projects reach:

- **Budget categories.** Part IV's Office Productivity and Continuing Costs
  are agency-wide budget, not the office's to edit, so they are excluded
  from the file — the office sees only their projects' budget lines — and
  are **not merged back** from project files: they contribute no overlay,
  sub-conflict, or flag on consolidate. A conflict on these two categories
  can only arise between offices holding unfiltered files.
- **Proposed IS (Part III-D).** The file's Proposed IS list contains only
  the carried projects' linked systems. A recipient who owns III-D can add
  systems of their own; on consolidate systems merge **by system id** —
  edits replace the master's system, new systems are appended with a review
  flag, and systems absent from the file are kept unflagged (a project
  filter selects projects, not systems — absence may just mean "not
  linked").

> **Mixed batches:** the by-project merge activates for the whole batch when
> *any* selected file declares a project filter. Returns from offices that
> got unfiltered files then also merge by project id — safer (rows missing
> from their file are kept, not dropped), but a deliberate deletion made by
> such an office will be silently retained, because without a declared filter
> the merge cannot distinguish "deleted" from "added to the master after
> distribution." Review those sections after applying if that matters.

## Things to keep in mind

- **Coordinate distribution rounds.** Generating a scoped file for an office starts
  their shared-table sections (stakeholders, Annex 1) **empty**. If an office that
  already contributed gets a fresh scoped file and returns it without re-entering
  their rows, consolidating it will replace their previous rows with none. Best
  practice: one distribution round per office, or tell them to keep their rows when
  they get an updated file.
- **Soft lock.** The scope is a UI/data gate, not encryption. A determined user
  *could* hand-edit the JSON. That's acceptable — it's the agency's own data, and
  the secretariat reviews everything on consolidate. Tamper-proofing can come later.
- **Legacy Annex 1 files still work.** Offices that send old-style standalone
  Annex 1 files can still be attached via the editor's "Attach Annex 1 files…" flow; both
  legacy-attached and scoped-consolidated Annex 1 entries coexist in the master and
  render in the PDF.
